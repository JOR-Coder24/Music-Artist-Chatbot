# Music-Artist-Chatbot

This project is a Python-based chatbot that uses the Spotify Web API to retrieve and display data about music artists. The bot can answer questions related to an artist's profile, albums, top tracks, and more. It features a simple and interactive graphical user interface (GUI) built using the Tkinter library. It's inspired by a previous project of mine "SuperBot"

"Music-Artist-Chatbot-With-Albums.py" is an additional program which does the same as the orginal but also gives data about an album(Name, Type, Total Tracks(no. tracks), Available Markets, Release Date, Artists, Label). NOTE-When running, must specify that it is an album in the question.

## Features

- **Search Music Artists**: Ask the bot about an artistâ€™s profile, top tracks, albums, genres, follower count, and Spotify ID.
- **Interactive GUI**: The chatbot is embedded in a GUI using Tkinter, which displays both user and bot messages with different colors for clarity.
- **Spotify Data**: The chatbot pulls data from Spotify through the Spotipy library, using artist search and API endpoints to fetch information.
